# Password Generator

## Description

I updated the JavaScript of a password generator application to create a random password based on criteria that the user selects from window prompts when they select "Generate Password" on the webpage.

## Software

I used Visual Studio Code to update the code in the script.js file.

## Application

The user clicks on the "Generate Password" button, and prompts come up. The user selects how many characters they would like their password to be, between 8 and 128 characters. The user selects what kind of characters they would like their password to have: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters. With this criteria, the application generates a random password for the user.

## Webpage

The following image shows a screenshot of the application:
